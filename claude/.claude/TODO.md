# Claude Code TODOs

## Vim Mode Configuration
- Waiting for .vimrc-like configuration support to remap Ctrl+Backspace to delete previous word
- Currently Ctrl+W works but conflicts with tmux vim-aware pane switching (bind-key -n C-w)
- Feature request to be submitted via /feedback

## Status Line
- Check if Claude Code allows disabling/styling the builtin git changes line

## Missing Plugins
- shellcheck
